Two different data types:

Scalar: integer, floating-point number, boolean, character

Compound:  tuple, array

Integer:

Length  | Signed | Unsigned
-----------------------------
8-bit   |i8      |u8
16-bit  |i16     |u16
32-bit  |i32     |u32
64-bit  |i64     |u64
128-bit |i128    |u128
arch    |isize   |usize

Signed can store -(2^(n-1)) to 2(^n-1) - 1, where n is the number of bits that variant uses
Unsigned can store (2^n) - 1
